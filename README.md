# Face-Recognition

## Basic Face Recognition using **face_recognition** module

I've chosen UFC star **Khabib Nurmagomedov's** photo to make this project.<br> What this module actually does is compares the encodings of **Known Images** and compares them for each of the **Unkown Images**. And then I used OpenCV to make a rectangle on the image and highlight the Name.<br>
So, wherever khabib is found in the image, his face is surrounded by a rectangle saying **Khabib**. And if not found the faces are surrounded by rectangles saying
**Not Found**.
